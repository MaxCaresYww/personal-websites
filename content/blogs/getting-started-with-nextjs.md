# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building modern web applications easier and more efficient. In this post, I'll share some key concepts and benefits of using Next.js.

## Why Choose Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages over vanilla React:

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Improves SEO and initial page load times
- Better performance for users
- Dynamic content rendering on the server

### 2. Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Pre-renders pages at build time
- Excellent for blogs and marketing sites
- Lightning-fast loading speeds

### 3. Built-in Optimization
- Automatic code splitting
- Image optimization
- Font optimization
- Bundle analysis

## Key Features

### File-Based Routing
```javascript
// pages/blog/[slug].js automatically creates routes like:
// /blog/my-first-post
// /blog/another-post
```

### API Routes
```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js API!' });
}
```

### CSS Support
- Built-in support for CSS Modules
- Sass support out of the box
- Easy integration with Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for modern web development, offering great developer experience and performance optimizations out of the box. Whether you're building a personal blog, e-commerce site, or complex web application, Next.js provides the tools you need to succeed.

Happy coding!
